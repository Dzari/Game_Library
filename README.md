# Game Library: Project Overview

Welcome to the **Game Library** repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of games ranging from simple, beginner-friendly titles to advanced, full-stack applications. It is organized into three categories: **Easy**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**, culminating in a final **Capstone Game** that integrates a variety of technologies and concepts.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Easy Games
**Technologies**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript

These games are focused on building fundamental web development and game programming skills. They do not require any external libraries or frameworks and are built using core web technologies.

#### Games:
- **Breakout Clone:**
  - Skills: DOM manipulation, basic game loop, collision detection, simple physics.
- **Memory Game (Concentration):**
  - Skills: DOM manipulation, event handling, state management.
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors:**
  - Skills: Randomization, user interaction, game logic.
- **Simple Snake Game:**
  - Skills: Basic animation, collision detection, game loop.

### 2. Intermediate Games
**Technologies**: TypeScript, HTML Canvas, Advanced JavaScript Concepts

These games leverage TypeScript for type safety and use the HTML Canvas API for rendering. They introduce more complex mechanics, algorithms, and visual effects.

#### Games:
- **Flappy Bird Clone:**
  - Skills: Gravity simulation, procedural obstacle generation, game loop.
- **Platformer Game:**
  - Skills: Physics (gravity, jumping), tile-based levels, character movement.
- **2D Tower Defense Game:**
  - Skills: Pathfinding, resource management, wave-based spawning, upgrade mechanics.
- **Roguelike Dungeon Crawler:**
  - Skills: Procedural generation, turn-based mechanics, item/inventory systems.

### 3. Advanced Games
**Technologies**: React, Phaser.js, Vue.js, Three.js

These games incorporate modern libraries and frameworks to handle more complex gameplay, animations, and interactions.

#### Games:
- **2D Arcade Game (Phaser.js):**
  - Skills: Asset management, game loop optimization, animations.
- **Match-3 Game (React):**
  - Skills: State management, grid-based interactions, animation effects.
- **Turn-Based Strategy Game (Vue.js):**
  - Skills: Component-based architecture, state management, complex UI interactions.
- **Real-Time 2D Game (Three.js):**
  - Skills: 3D rendering, camera controls, basic physics.

### 4. Capstone Game
**Technologies**: Full-Stack Application

The final game will be a showcase of all the skills learned throughout the project. It will integrate advanced gameplay mechanics with backend functionality.

#### Features:
- Online leaderboard
- Multiplayer mode
- Persistent world state
- User authentication
- AI opponents
- Cloud saving

#### Technologies:
- **Frontend:** React or Vue.js
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express or FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Authentication:** OAuth, JWT
- **Hosting:** AWS, Firebase, or Heroku

## Tools and Workflow

### Tools:
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Package Management:** npm, Yarn
- **Build Tools:** Vite, Webpack
- **Code Quality:** ESLint, Prettier
- **Testing:** Jest, Playwright
- **Graphics and Assets:** Figma, Adobe Illustrator

### Workflow:
1. Each game is developed in a dedicated branch and merged into the main branch upon completion.
2. Issues and tasks are tracked using GitHub Projects.
3. Pull requests undergo code reviews to maintain quality and consistency.
